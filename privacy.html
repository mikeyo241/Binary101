            There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with
            other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Binary101 Account,
            we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect
            with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear
            how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
            Our Privacy Policy explains:
            What information we collect and why we collect it.
            How we use that information.
            The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.
            We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags
            and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Binary101 so whether you are new to Binary101
            or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.


            For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Binary101 Account.
            When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit
            card to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might
            also ask you to create a publicly visible Binary101 Profile, which may include your name and photo.
            Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use
            and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising
            services, or view and interact with our ads and content.
            We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version,
            unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Binary101 may
            associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Binary101 Account.

            When you use our services or view content provided by Binary101, we automatically collect and store
            certain information in server logs. This includes:
            details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
            telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers,
            time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.
            Internet protocol address.
            device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type,
            browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
            cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Binary101 Account.
            When you use Binary101 services, we may collect and process information about your actual
            location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other
            sensors that may, for example, provide Binary101 with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access
            points and cell towers.

            Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your
            installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to
            Binary101 when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers,
            such as for automatic updates.

            We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using
            mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.

            We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Binary101
            service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device.
            We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer
            to our partners, such as advertising services or Binary101 features that may appear on other sites. Our
            Binary101 Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and
            apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick
            cookie, Binary101 Analytics information is linked, by the Binary101 Analytics customer or by Binary101,
            using Binary101 technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.
            Information we collect when you are signed in to Binary101, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners,
            may be associated with your Binary101 Account. When information is associated with your Binary101 Account, we treat it as
            personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated
            with your Binary101 Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy.

            We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop
            new ones, and to protect Binary101 and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like
            giving you more relevant search results and ads.
            We may use the name you provide for your Binary101 Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Binary101
            Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Binary101 Account so that you are represented
            consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we
            may show them your publicly visible Binary101 Profile information, such as your name and photo.
            If you have a Binary101 Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Binary101 or on
            third-party applications connected to your Binary101 Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in
            our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit
            sharing or visibility settings in your Binary101 Account.
            When you contact Binary101, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We
            may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or
            improvements.
            We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience
            and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Binary101 Analytics.
            For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you
            prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with
            sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
            Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features,
            such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.
            We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from
            other Binary101 services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your
            account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to
            improve Binary101’s services and the ads delivered by Binary101.
            We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy
            Policy.
            Binary101 processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your
            personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.
            Transparency and choice
            People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make
            meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:
            Review and update your Binary101 activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched
            on YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Binary101 services. You can
            also visit these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your
            device when you use our services while signed-out of your account.
            Review and control certain types of information tied to your Binary101 Account by using Binary101 Dashboard.
            View and edit your preferences about the Binary101 ads shown to you on Binary101 and across the web, such as
            which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Binary101
            advertising services.
            Adjust how the Profile associated with your Binary101 Account appears to others.
            Control who you share information with through your Binary101 Account.
            Take information associated with your Binary101 Account out of many of our services.
            Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.
            You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when
            a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly
            if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.

            Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may
            be indexable. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and
            removing your content.
            Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information
            is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for
            legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity
            before we can act on your request.
            We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example,
            developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be
            extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
            Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a
            disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or
            malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete
            residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

            We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Binary101 when we
            have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
            With domain administrators
            If your Binary101 Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for G Suite users) then your
            domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your
            Binary101 Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:
            view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.
            change your account password.
            suspend or terminate your account access.
            access or retain information stored as part of your account.
            receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or
            enforceable governmental request.
            restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.
            Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.
            For external processing
            We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us,
            based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality
            and security measures.

            We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Binary101 if we have a
            good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
            meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
            enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
            detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
            protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Binary101, our users or the public as required or
            permitted by law.
            We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or
            connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our
            services.
            If Binary101 is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal
            information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different
            privacy policy.

            We work hard to protect Binary101 and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
            destruction of information we hold.
            Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Binary101 Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, services
            Binary101 provides on Android devices, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but
            excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
            Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that
            may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Binary101 services, or other sites linked from our
            services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who
            advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
            Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities
            We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks,
            including the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person
            who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data
            protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our
            users directly.

            Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your
            explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide
            a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep
            prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.

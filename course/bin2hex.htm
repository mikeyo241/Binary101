	<h1>Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion</h1>

	<h2>About Hexadecimal</h2>
	
	<p>Hexadecimal – also known as hex or base 16 – is a system we can use to 
		write and share numerical values.<br><br>
		Hex, like decimal, combines a set of digits to create large numbers. 
		It just so happens that hex uses a set of 16 unique digits. Hex uses the 
		standard 0-9, but it also incorporates six digits you wouldn’t usually 
		expect to see creating numbers: A, B, C, D, E, and F. <br><br>

		There are many (infinite!) other numeral systems out there. 
		Binary (base 2) is also popular in the engineering world, because 
		it’s the language of computers. The base 2, binary, system uses just 
		two digit values (0 and 1) to represent numbers.<br><br>

		Hex, along with decimal and binary, is one of the most commonly encountered 
		numeral systems in the world of electronics and programming. It’s important 
		to understand how hex works, because, in many cases, it makes more sense to 
		represent a number in base 16 than with binary or decimal.

	<h2>Subscripts</h2>
	<p>Decimal and hexadecimal have 10 digits in common, so they can create a lot of 
		similar-looking numbers. But 10 in hex is a wholly different number from that in 
		decimal. In fact hex 10 is equivalent to decimal 16. We need a way to explicitly 
		state whether a number we’re talking about is base 10 or base 16 (or base 8, or 
		base 2). Enter base subscripts:<br>

	<h2>Converting To/From Decimal</h2>
	<p>Converting from decimal to hex involves a lot of division and remainders.<br><br>
		The steps to convert a number, let’s call it N, from decimal to hex look something like this:<br></p>
		
	<ol>
		<li>Divide N by 16. The remainder of that division is the first (least-significant/right-most)
			digit of your hex number. Take the quotient (the result of the division) to the next step.<br>
			Note: if the remainder is 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15, then that becomes the hex digit 
			A, B, C, D, E, or F.
		</li>
		<li>Divide the quotient from the last step by 16 again. The remainder of this division is 
			the second digit of your hex value (second-from-the-right). Take the quotient from this 
			division to the next step.
		</li>
		<li>Divide the quotient from step 2 by 16 again. The remainder of this division is the third 
			digit of your hex conversion. Noticing a pattern?
		</li>
		<li>Keep dividing your quotient from the last step by 16, and storing the remainder until the 
			result of a division is 0. The remainder of that division is your hex value’s left-most, 
			most-significant digit.
		</li>

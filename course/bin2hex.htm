	<h1>Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion</h1>

	<h2>About Hexadecimal</h2>
	
	<p>Hexadecimal – also known as hex or base 16 – is a system we can use to 
		write and share numerical values.<br><br>
		Hex, like decimal, combines a set of digits to create large numbers. 
		It just so happens that hex uses a set of 16 unique digits. Hex uses the 
		standard 0-9, but it also incorporates six digits you wouldn’t usually 
		expect to see creating numbers: A, B, C, D, E, and F. <br><br>

		There are many (infinite!) other numeral systems out there. 
		Binary (base 2) is also popular in the engineering world, because 
		it’s the language of computers. The base 2, binary, system uses just 
		two digit values (0 and 1) to represent numbers.<br><br>

		Hex, along with decimal and binary, is one of the most commonly encountered 
		numeral systems in the world of electronics and programming. It’s important 
		to understand how hex works, because, in many cases, it makes more sense to 
		represent a number in base 16 than with binary or decimal.

	<h2>Subscripts</h2>
	<p>Decimal and hexadecimal have 10 digits in common, so they can create a lot of 
		similar-looking numbers. But 10 in hex is a wholly different number from that in 
		decimal. In fact hex 10 is equivalent to decimal 16. We need a way to explicitly 
		state whether a number we’re talking about is base 10 or base 16 (or base 8, or 
		base 2). Enter base subscripts:<br>

	<h2>Converting To/From Decimal</h2>
	
	<h3>Converting from Decimal to Hex</h3>
	
	<p>Converting from decimal to hex involves a lot of division and remainders.<br><br>
		The steps to convert a number, let’s call it N, from decimal to hex look something like this:<br></p>
		
	<ol>
		<li>Divide N by 16. The remainder of that division is the first (least-significant/right-most)
			digit of your hex number. Take the quotient (the result of the division) to the next step.<br>
			Note: if the remainder is 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15, then that becomes the hex digit 
			A, B, C, D, E, or F.
		</li>
		<li>Divide the quotient from the last step by 16 again. The remainder of this division is 
			the second digit of your hex value (second-from-the-right). Take the quotient from this 
			division to the next step.
		</li>
		<li>Divide the quotient from step 2 by 16 again. The remainder of this division is the third 
			digit of your hex conversion. Noticing a pattern?
		</li>
		<li>Keep dividing your quotient from the last step by 16, and storing the remainder until the 
			result of a division is 0. The remainder of that division is your hex value’s left-most, 
			most-significant digit.
		</li>
		
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Converting from Hex to Decimal</h3>
	
	<p>There’s an ugly equation that rules over hex-to-decimal conversion:<br></p>
	
	<img src="assets/img/hex2bin.png" alt="Hex2Bin">
	
	<p>There are a few important elements to this equation. Each of the h factors (hn, hn-1) is a 
	single digit of the hex value. If our hex value is F00D, for example, h0 is D, h1 and h2 are 
	0, and h3 is F.<br>

	Powers of 16 are a critical part of hexadecimal. More-signficant digits (those towards the 
	left side of the number) are multiplied by larger powers of 16. The least-significant digit, 
	h0, is multiplied by 160 (1). If a hex value is four digits long, the most-significant digit is 
	multiplied by 163, or 4096.<br>

	To convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, you need to plug in values for each of the h factors 
	in the equation above. Then multiply each digit by its respective power of 16, and add each product 
	up. Our step-by-step approach is:<br><br>
	</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Start with the right-most digit of your hex value. Multiply it by 160, that is: 
		multiply by 1. In other words, leave it be, but keep that value off to the side.<br>
		Remember to convert alphabetic hex values (A, B, C, D, E, and F) to their decimal 
		equivalent (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15).
		</li>
		<li>Move one digit to the left. Multiply that digit by 161 (i.e. multipy by 16). 
		Remember that product, and keep it to the side.
		</li>
		<li>Move another digit left. Multiply that digit by 162 (256) and store that product.
		</li>
		<li>Continue multiplying each incremental digit of the hex value by increasing powers 
		of 16 (4096, 65536, 1048576, …), and remember each product.
		</li>
		<li>Once you’ve multiplied each digit of the hex value by the proper power of 16, add 
		them all up. That sum is the decimal equivalent of your hex value.
		</li>
	</ol>

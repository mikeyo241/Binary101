	<h1>Venn Diagrams</h1>
	
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	
	<p>Venn Diagram - a diagram representing mathematical or logical sets pictorially as 
	circles or closed curves within an enclosing rectangle (the universal set), common elements 
	of the sets being represented by the areas of overlap among the circles.<br>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Venn Diagram Sets</h2>
	
	<h3>Intersection of two sets: A &cap; B</h3>
	
	<img src="intersection.png" alt="intersection">
	
	<p>The intersection of a venn diagram only contains the data that is shared between
	both of the sets.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Union of two sets: A &cup; B</h3>
	
	<img src="union.png" alt="union">
	
	<p>The union of a venn diagram contains all of the data in either and both sets.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Symmetric Difference of two sets: A &#x25B3; B</h3>
	
	<img src="symmetric-difference.png" alt="symmetric-difference">
	
	<p>The symmetric difference of a venn diagram contains only the data that one or
	the other set has but does not contain the data shared by the sets.
	
	<h3>Relative Complement of A(left) in B(right): A<sup>C</sup> &cup; B = B \ A</h3>
	
	<img src="relative-complement.png" alt="relative-complement">
	
	<p>The relative complement of a venn diagram contain only the data of one set that is 
	unique to only that set.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Absolute Complement of A in U: A<sup>C</sup> = U \ A</h3>
	
	<img src="absolute-complement.png" alt="absolute-complement">
	
	<p>The absolute complement of a venn diagram contains the data of one set that is unique to 
	only that set and all of the data that is not contained in any of the sets of data.
	</p>

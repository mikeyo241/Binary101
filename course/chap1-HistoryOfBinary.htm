            <h1>The History of Binary</h1>
            <p>We all have seen binary before whether it be in movies, TV shows, or on the internet we all have an understanding
                that binary is the 1's and 0's that computers use to operate.
                To a computer binary is converted to electrical signals a high voltage for a
                1 and a low voltage for 0. Tiny transistors in the CPU are used to process
                these signals to produce everything that you see on screen.  It has been theorized
                by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors double every 2 years.
                Which although under very skeptical criticism has proved true for 42 years(1975-current year).
            </p>
            <p><b>Moore's Law</b> -  is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.</p>
            <p><b>Binary</b> -  a system of numerical notation to the base 2, in which each place of a number, expressed as 0 or 1, corresponds to a power of 2.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/mooresLaw.png" >
            <p>In 1679 a German polymath and philosopher  named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz documented the binary system.
                Binary is used in computers because it is the most practical way for a computer to process data.</p>

            <h2>Why learn how binary works?</h2>

            <p>If you are going into Programming the programs you will be writing in a high level language
                such as C++ will be compiled into assembly language which is binary.
                <br>
                If you are going into IT, binary is used to transmit data across networks
                and chips, It is used to stored data onto the hard drive.
                <br>
                Every letter you type is ASCii which is a standard that computers used to encode
                letters into binary you will learn more about ASCii in later Chapters.

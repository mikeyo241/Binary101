	<h1>Binary Math</h1>
	
	<h2>Position</h2>
	
	<p>In the Decimal System there are Ones, Tens, Hundreds, etc<br><nr>
		In Binary there are Ones, Twos, Fours, etc, like this:

	<h2>Binary Addition</h2>
	
	<p>Now that we know binary numbers, we will learn how to add them. Binary addition 
	is much like your normal everyday addition (decimal addition), except that it carries 
	on a value of 2 instead of a value of 10.<br><br>
	For example: in decimal addition, if you add 8 + 2 you get ten, which you write as 10; 
	in the sum this gives a digit 0 and a carry of 1. Something similar happens in binary 
	addition when you add 1 and 1; the result is two (as always), but since two is written as 
	10 in binary, we get, after summing 1 + 1 in binary, a digit 0 and a carry of 1.<br><br>

	Therefore in binary:<br>
	0 + 0 = 0<br>
	0 + 1 = 1<br>
	1 + 0 = 1<br>
	1 + 1 = 10 (which is 0 carry 1)<br>
	</p>

	<h2>Binary Subtraction</h2>
	
	<p>Binary subtraction is also similar to that of decimal subtraction with the difference 
	that when 1 is subtracted from 0, it is necessary to borrow 1 from the next higher order bit 
	and that bit is reduced by 1 (or 1 is added to the next bit of subtrahend) and the remainder is 1.<br><br>
	Thus the rules of binary subtraction are as follows:<br>
	</p>
	
	<table style="width:25%">
		<tr>
			<th>-</th>
			<th>0</th>
			<th>1</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>0 - 0 = 0<br>
	1 - 0 = 1<br>
	1 - 1 = 0<br>
	0 - 1 = 1 (with a borrow of 1)<br><br>
	For fractional numbers, the rules of subtraction are the same with the 
	binary point properly placed.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Binary Multiplication</h2>
	
	<p>Binary multiplication uses the same algorithm, but uses just three 
	order-independent facts: 0 x 0 = 0, 1 x 0 = 0, and 1 x 1 = 1 (these work 
	the same as in decimal). If you perform the multiplication phase with these 
	facts, you’ll notice two things: there are never any carries, and the partial 
	products will either be zeros or a shifted copy of the multiplicand.<br><br>

	Observing this, you’ll realize there’s no need for digit-by-digit 
	multiplication, which means there’s no need to consult a times table — 
	which means there’s no multiplication, period! Instead, you just write 
	down 0 when the current digit of the multiplier is 0, and you write down 
	the multiplicand when the current digit of the multiplier is 1.<br><br>
	</p>

	<p>Each step is the placement of an entire partial product, unlike in decimal, 
	where each step is a single-digit multiplication (and possible addition of a carry).<br><br>

	In the addition phase, the partial products are added using binary addition, 
	and then the radix point is placed appropriately. This gives the answer 1001001.001.<br><br>

	<h2>Binary Division</h2>
	
	<p>The method followed in binary division is also similar to that adopted 
	in decimal system. However, in the case of binary numbers, the operation is simpler 
	because the quotient can have either 1 or 0 depending upon the divisor.<br><br>
	The table for binary division is:
	</p>
	
	<table style="width:25%">
		<tr>
			<th>-</th>
			<th>1</th>
			<th>0</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Meaning less</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>Meaning less</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

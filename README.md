## Testing Logins and Sign up features

If you want to test the login part of the site you must view it from the CIT server at:  
http://205.186.33.94/~mgardne1/Group6/Binary101/main.php

I will try to keep it updated as much as possible if you update the site you can upload the   
project to your folder on the CIT server it will still work.




##How to pull this repository from git hub!
Download Git Hub for your computer here:   
**Windows** https://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe  
**Mac** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://central.github.com/mac/latest

Click the + Sign on the top left of the screen and clone the project to a directory on your computer.  
After you clone it to your computer any changes that you make you can update with the git hub application.  

Goto the changes tab at the top of the application

Put a meaningful short summary about what you did to the file and a description so we all know what you did!!!

Click Commit to master if you are unsure about the change you are making create a branch and commit it to the branch  
and we all can review the changes that you have made to the project and we can then change it if it is right.

## Fix the git.exe error on PHPStorm

In order to fix this problem you will have to download git here: https://git-scm.com/download/win  
You will still need to download this if you have the Git-hub GUI!


Then go to settings > version control > git  
place path in **Path to Git Executable** 
Path: C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe  
**PATH MAY NOT BE THE SAME ON YOUR COMPUTER!** IF IT ISN'T SEARCH FOR git.exe
